<p>At its core, Gremloon is a programmable framework focused on education that provides interactive computing environments to learners and educators.</p>
<p>The technology is based on a reinvention of Jupyter Notebooks, with user-friendliness for non-technical users in mind,  borrowing on best-practices from scientific computing/ML for visualizations.</p>
<p>We designed our interfaces for a broad skill level - ranging from non-technical users to software developers.</p>
<p>For non-technical users we provide user interfaces and a growing catalog of existing widgets, that can be applied or altered via drag&amp;drop.<br>For technical users, we provide full access either through APIs or direct access via Python modules.</p>
<h4 id="be-the-architect">Be the architect</h3>
<p>Our framework provides a certain structure within one can work. At the start, we provide an empty house that is ready to be remodeled and decorated by creating rooms, adding content and visualizations.</p>
<p>Additional rooms can be created on the fly, to present the opportunity for breakout sessions, brainstorming, or other sorts of activities.</p>
<p>We designed the application with easy interaction and collaboration between all participants in mind.</p>
<h4 id="core-modules">Core modules</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>a <strong>Render module</strong> based on streamlits app framework, allowing content creation with:

</li>
<li><p>an <strong>Assessments module</strong>, which allows assessing learners understanding</p>
</li>
<li><p>an <strong>Analytics module</strong>, which allows inbuilt real-time analytics and visualization on any data produced within the system, supporting popular graphing libraries such as Plotly, bokeh, Vega, etc.

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="out-of-the-box-or-proprietary-">Out of the box or proprietary?</h3>
<p>All modules are designed in a way that they can either be used as-is, accessed through APIs and in the case of Assessments / Analytics completely swapped out for proprietary logic/solutions entirely. </p>
<h4 id="adaptive-information-in-development-">Adaptive information (in development)</h3>
<p>Our framework allows the implementation of conditional logic into the flow.
Information, that can be displayed to the user, can be made conditional on events and data gathered through user interaction. This further allows the integration of individual learning logic such as spaced repetition ...</p>
